> Posthog is a product analytics tool which measures visitor data and other vital analytics when integrated on your website.
> Integrating with Posthog helps you understand user behaviour and user interaction by observing session replays and pages viewed
> which ultimately helps in making efforts towards user retention and catching bug fixes.

In this article, we will explore on how I have used Posthog's pageview autocapture technique to display page views on each of my blog posts.

Let us start by integrating Posthog on our website by following the [installation instructions](https://posthog.com/docs/getting-started/install).

Once integrated successfully, Posthog will autocapture pageviews, website traffic and other demographic data for you.

Luckily for us, all of this data is stored in Posthog's servers and is accessible via the API. Create a project and an API key using
this [document](https://posthog.com/docs/api).

## Method

When a user visits the website, a `$pageview` event is created and stored on his behalf.
There are various event properties associated with the event:

- anonymous_id
- device
- library
- event_time
- browser
- current_url, etcetra.

We can use the `current_url` property to calculate how many times a specific page was queried.
Each of my blog posts has a `slug` property used to route users to the page. The value of the slug is what is captured in the `current_url`
event property of a `$pageview` event recorded by Posthog.

## APIs

We will be using the [Query](https://posthog.com/docs/api/query) API to count the number of times a `$pageview` event was recorded.
Posthog uses [HogQL](https://posthog.com/docs/hogql) query syntax to query Posthog servers, an example query looks like the following.

```js
export async function getPageViews({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  return fetch(
    `https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID}/query`,
    {
      method: 'post',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: {
          kind: 'EventsQuery',
          select: ['count(*)'],
          properties: [
            {
              key: '$current_url',
              operator: 'icontains',
              type: 'event',
              value: slug,
            },
          ],
          after: 'all',
          event: '$pageview',
        },
      }),
    }
  )
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => data)
    .catch((err) => {
      throw err;
    });
}
```

The query returns the number of times `$pageview` event was recorded for this given blog post slug; it can be accessed using `data.results[0]`.

## Considerations

- The query `POST` API is a part of private endpoint which is rate limited by Posthog to `120/hour`. We can go around this by using caching libraries on the
  frontend like `react-query` and invalidating/refetching the counts every 5 minutes or so.
- The event logs might be asynchronous and processed in batches by Posthog; therefore the page view counts might not be
  instantaneously updated.
