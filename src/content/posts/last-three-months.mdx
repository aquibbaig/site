On September 16, I decided to quit my job & take care of
my health and fitness. I was getting overburdened with stress and
affected by poor gut health.

For the **last three months**, I have been putting in conscious effort
to maintain a better lifestyle -- eating healthy, going to the gym
everyday, playing outdoors, and reducing screen time.

## Confronting passion

I quickly realised my passion for building things on my computer and
the detachment from that -- even for a couple of days was hard. This
constant urge to keep building something, figuring out how stuff works,
is something that fuels my passion everyday.

## Back to open source

I got a chance to rekindle old habits and started contributing to **open source** projects.

I have always loved how smart Typescript's inference system is and used to solve questions on [Typehero](https://typehero.dev/).
During the break, I took an opportunity to contribute to the project:

- refresh two slash hints on code changes - [#1628](https://github.com/typehero/typehero/pull/1628)
- add functionality to reply & refactor comments section - [#1640](https://github.com/typehero/typehero/pull/1640)
- WIP / migration to nextjs 15 & react 19 - [#1654](https://github.com/typehero/typehero/pull/1654)
- fix explore section width overflow - [#1705](https://github.com/typehero/typehero/pull/1705)

Also, one fine day I noticed a markup error on the Nodejs website and decided to send a PR.

- fix table markup in branding pages [#7085](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7085)

## Recovery 💪🏼

I got a chance to read and listen to some wonderful stories of people achieving ambitious things together.
My last read was [Facebook's Little Book](https://www.map.cv/) which inspired me astronomically.

All this inspiration is slowly reigniting my love for building things _(subjective)_, and the burnout seems
to be fading as well. I believe I can make a positive impact in the world through my craft.

Work aside, I finally learnt how to cook and its becoming one of my dearest hobbies to decompress from work.

As I step back into this **wild job market**, I feel excited to explore my passion to build impactful
things, inspire people and contribute to projects.
