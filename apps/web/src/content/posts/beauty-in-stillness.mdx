Something strange has woken up in me for the past year. I have started to understand, see, and admire beauty in the simple and routine things in life.
Moments that seemed boring and dull have started to become more interesting and beautiful.

Sitting on the beach, watching the ocean waves silently wash away the dust beneath your feet,
the cool summer evening breeze gently moving your hair, the shadow of the tree falling on the ground with
its leaves moving in unison — the idea of things occurring perpetually around silence.
I have started to appreciate these things more and more.

It's not that I didn't appreciate these things before, but I never really understood the beauty in them. I was always in a hurry to get to the next thing,
to do something, to be somewhere. I was always in a hurry to fill the void with people or tasks.

I keep wondering why people are so afraid of being alone. Why do we always need to fill the void with noise? Why do we always need to be doing something?
Why can't we just sit and enjoy the moment?

We often conceal the beauty of simple things beneath the clamor of our everyday routines. It's only when we step away from the hectic pace of life,
liberated from the stress and pressure of work, that we can truly value the serenity of living at ease.
In this contemporary world, we are constantly stimulated to make us feel something or anything at all.
Once those stimulations are gone, our mind is relaxed, our body is free. There is no thought of future or past, the present in which we are simply existing.

Sometimes I find the silence talking back to me, which is pretty strange. The voice of my heart, my soul, my inner self compels me to take a deep breath, calm down,
let go of the stress, and just be.

"It’s when things are truly silent can your heart really speak."
